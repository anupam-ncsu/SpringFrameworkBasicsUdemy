Like a Good OO coding, we made object of SortThenSearch.
We made new object of the Search algorithm that we want to plug in (bubblesort).
We injected the dependency (bubblesort) into Execution.
This gives the CONTROL of the execution to the user

With Spring we want to get rid of Dependency injection and thus do inversion of control from USER to FRAMEWROK
Spring should create the object and inject it whereever it is required. Thus INVERSION OF CONTROL from user to FRAMEWORK
